  <div class="col-lg-6">&nbsp;<font size="4">The dachshund is a creation of German breeders and includes elements of German, French, and English hounds and terriers. Dachshunds have been kept by royal courts all over Europe, including that of Queen Victoria, who was particularly enamored of the breedA typical dachshund is long-bodied and muscular with short stubby legs. Its front paws are disproportionately large, being paddle-shaped and particularly suitable for digging. Its skin is loose enough not to tear while tunneling in tight burrows to chase prey. The dachshund has a deep chest which provides plenty of space for heart development and lung capacity. Its snout is long.A full-grown standard dachshund typically weighs 7.5 kg (16 lb) to 14.5 kg (32 lb), while the miniature variety normally weighs less than 5.5 kg (12 lb).Dachshunds are playful, but as hunting dogs can be quite stubborn, and are known for their propensity for chasing small animals, birds, and tennis balls with great determination and ferocity.As dachshunds were originally used as badger hunters they have a keen sense for chasing smaller animals. Dachshunds are often stubborn, making them a challenge to train.They are often nicknamed wiener or sausage dog</font></div>

    <h5 class="card-title">•	Degenerative disc disease</h5>
    
    <p class="card-text">Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a medical condition typically brought on by the normal aging process in which there are anatomic changes and possibly a loss of function of one or more intervertebral discs of the spine. DDD can take place with or without symptoms, but is typically identified once symptoms arise. The root cause is thought to be loss of soluble proteins within the fluid contained in the disc with resultant reduction of the oncotic pressure, which in turn causes loss of fluid volume. Normal downward forces cause the affected disc to lose height, and the distance between vertebrae is reduced. The anulus fibrosus, the tough outer layers of a disc, also weakens</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">•	Candidiasis</h5>
   
    <p class="card-text">A bird with candidiasis, also known as thrush, will typically show white lesions in the mouth and throat and may also be vomiting. Appetite loss is quite common, due to the difficulty in swallowing. This illness is caused by a type of yeast infection and is most often treated with antifungal medication and keeping a cleaner environment, particularly food and water dishes.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">•	Giardiasis</h5>
    
    <p class="card-text">This disease is recognized by the combination of diarrhea or vomiting, weight loss and dry, itching skin, which may cause birds to nibble at or pluck their feathers. There are drug treatments for this illness, and it is important that pet birds are not overcrowded, and they have clean water to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">•	Goiters</h5>
    
    <p class="card-text">A goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland due to iodine deficiency, and in addition to a swollen throat, pet birds with goiters may be reluctant to feed because of difficulty swallowing, and their voices may change. Vomiting, weight loss and wheezing are other common symptoms. Dietary adjustments can help eliminate and prevent goiters, and iodine supplements may be necessary in severe cases.</p>

      <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">PBFD</h6>
   
    <p class="card-text">Infected birds may take weeks to years before showing any clinical signs, often depending on the bird’s age. Often, the first visible clinical sign is either necrotic (dead), misshapen, or abnormally formed feathers (feather dystrophy), or severe beak deformation. Once symptoms are noted and the diagnosis confirmed by laboratory analysis, most birds die from secondary infections within months to years after presentation.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">•	Weight loss</h5>
    
    <p class="card-text">Dangerous especially to small birds, who don't have much in the way of bodily reserves. Most casual bird owners don't weigh their birds very often, so it's important to work with a vet to check a bird's weight. Sometimes you can tell by feeling the keel bone, the bone that runs down the center of the bird's chest -- if it sticks out like a razor, the bird is starving! In a healthy bird, there's so much flesh on the chest you can hardly feel the bone.</p>
