  <div class="col-lg-6">&nbsp;<font size="4">The Doberman pinscher is a medium-large, deep-chested dog breed with a sleek and sturdy appearance. Dobermans (also called "Dobes" or "Dobies") are fearless, loyal, and highly intelligent. These traits make them ideal police, war, and guard dogs, but they are also outstanding companions.Well-trained Dobermans often do very great with children and in various social situations, and they can make great therapy dogs. The breed's temperament is generally known to be docile yet protective. The Doberman, which was first bred in Germany, has earned a reputation as a fierce guard dog. However, the breed is usually quite gentle and not aggressive by nature.Though many people think of Dobermans as serious dogs, they can actually be a bit goofy and rambunctious at times, especially as puppies. They will do well with children and enjoy playing together as long as the child is old enough to treat the dog with consideration. Still, they are also easily trained and have the drive to learn alongside their owner.</font></div>

          <p class="card-text">Chronic Active Hepatitis or CAH is a disease where the liver cannot successfully metabolize copper which is present in many foods your dog consumes or that are part of his packaged dog food. The copper then builds up to toxic levels. This can lead to an accumulation of scar tissue, ending in liver failure and death. CAH is more common among females than males and often appears between four and six years of age. The first symptom is often extreme thirst, though this may not be constant and thus go unnoticed. </p>

Caused by a lowered production of thyroid hormones, this often hereditary condition is also fairly common in medium to large breed dogs, including Dobermans. Dogs should be tested annually as the condition may develop at any time.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Bloat in your dog can occur in all deep-chested dogs, including Dobermans. It's an emergency condition where the stomach twists, cutting off the esophagus at one end and the intestines at the other, causing a build-up of gas and obstructing the flow of blood and food material. It may occur when the dog is fed a heavy or difficult to digest meal or eats too fast. Additionally, some veterinarians warn against exercise immediately after eating to avoid this weird, rare medical occurrence.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Hip dysplasia is a malformation of the hip joint where the ball and socket do not fit closely together and can lead to weakness and pain. This disorder is influenced by both heredity and environmental factors. It may become apparent in puppyhood or later as a form of osteoarthritis.If hip dysplasia is suspected, your veterinarian may order blood work and urinalysis and take an x-ray of your dog's hips and lower spine. Treatment includes symptom management and sometimes surgery. The surgical options vary depending on the age and size of the dog. Non-surgical approaches to symptom management include anti-inflammatory medication, physical and hydrotherapy, weight loss, and dietary changes.</p>
