  <div class="col-lg-6">&nbsp;<font size="4">The Rhodesian ridgeback is a large hound dog breed from Africa that has a short, smooth coat with a distinctive ridge of fur running down its spine. The ridge grows in the opposite direction from the rest of the fur. Having been bred to hunt big game, including lions, ridgebacks possess a high prey drive. They need consistent training and proper socialization and might not be ideal for first-time dog owners. However, they tend to be loyal and affectionate with their family.Ridgebacks are athletic dogs with a moderate energy level. They often bond closely with their family and have a protective streak to their temperament. That personality trait can cause them to be wary around strangers, but they don’t tend to bark a lot.</font></div>

          <h5 class="card-title">•	Dysplasia</h5>
         
          <p class="card-text">Rhodesian Ridgebacks are large-breed dogs and like other large breeds are more susceptible to hip and elbow dysplasia.This degenerative issue is caused by abnormal connective tissues and bones in the hip and elbows. The dysplasia causes looseness of the joints and degenerative changes through rubbing that lead to pain and weakness within the joint, which eventually causes mobility issues. For many dogs, there may not be signs of dysplasia until they become older. Severe cases typically present in younger dogs and surgery may be necessary. For older dogs, dysplasia can be managed with pain management, joint supplements, and weight management. Other alternative therapies may be used, including physical therapy, laser treatments, or acupuncture.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Dermoids happen during development and are tube-like openings that are defects of the nervous system and skin.They are usually found after birth and can be severe- sometimes they go as deep as the spinal canal. The sinuses may become infected and can be very painful. Breeders normally have puppies tested and treated through surgical intervention before the puppy is sent to their new home. Dermoids can return if they’re not removed properly, so it’s important to get the full health history of any puppy from the breeder before bringing them home.

          <p class="card-text">Rhodesian Ridgebacks are known to develop thyroid issues, specifically Autoimmune Thyroiditis, which can cause low thyroid hormone levels. A decrease in the production of thyroid hormones can cause a variety of issues in your pet, including, but not limited to lethargy, weight gain, changes in coat, ear and skin infections, skin pigmentation changes, heat-seeking behavior (they’re cold), and an inability to regrow good quality hair. Ask your veterinarian to check your pet’s levels once a year to make sure you catch any thyroid issues so your pet can begin treatment as soon as possible.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">•Early Onset Adult Deafness</h5>
          
          <p class="card-text">Rhodesian Ridgebacks have been known to suffer early onset adult deafness (EOAD) in which they start to lose their hearing within 1 or 2 years after birth. This condition can also appear as young as 4 months of age and has long been believed to be caused by genetics. Through years of collaborative research with scientists, breeders, and dog owners, Embark scientists recently determined that the hearing loss is caused by a variant in the EPS8L2 gene and that both parents must be carriers to pass it on to their offspring.Enhanced genetic testing will help prepare dog owners for the time that their Rhodesian Ridgeback goes deaf. Training them young with a combination of visual cues and learning how to avoid sudden movements to avoid startling them will be vital for helping them transition to a non-hearing life.</p>

          <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">bloat.</h6>
          <p class="card-text">Cataracts, a “clouding” of the eye lens, can affect your pet’s vision as the lens is not transparent to allow proper vision. This usually appears as white spots or haze over the cornea in either or both eyes.For some dogs, the cataract may appear small and remain so, which won’t impact the dog’s vision much. For other dogs, it may completely cloud the lens, leading to a loss of sight. Speak with your vet as soon as you notice the cataract, as surgery is a possible treatment option.</p>
