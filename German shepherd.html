  <div class="col-lg-6">&nbsp;<font size="4">German Shepherd Dogs are smart and energetic large sized dogs that are popular with active families. They are highly trainable, have a unique instinct to protect and make great companions and superb watchdogs. They are known for their bushy, thick tails, pointy ears and wolf-like appearance.German Shepherds are a popular selection for use as working dogs.They are known for being easy to train and good for performing tasks and following instructions. They are especially well known for their police work, being used for tracking criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of suspects. Additionally, thousands of German Shepherds have been used by the military. These military working dogs (MWD) are usually trained for scout duty, and they are used to warn soldiers to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards. German Shepherds have also been trained by military groups to parachute from aircraft or as anti-tank weapons. They were used in World War II as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal guard dogs. A number of these dogs were taken home by foreign servicemen, who were impressed by their intelligence.

    The German Shepherd is one of the most widely used breeds in a wide variety of scent-work roles. These include search and rescue, cadaver searching, narcotics detection, explosives detection, accelerant detection and mine detection dog, among others. They are suited for these lines of work because of their keen sense of smell and their ability to work regardless of distractions. At one time the German Shepherd was the breed chosen almost exclusively to be used as a guide dog for the visually impaired. When formal guide dog training began in Switzerland in the 1920s under the leadership of Dorothy Eustis, all of the dogs trained were German Shepherd females. An experiment in temperament testing of a group of Labrador Retrievers and German Shepherds showed that the Retrievers scored higher on average in emotional stability, ability to recover promptly from frightening situations, cooperative behaviour and friendliness; while the German Shepherds were superior in aggression and defensive behaviour. These results suggested that Labrador Retrievers were more suited to guide dog work while German Shepherds were more suited to police work.

        <p class="card-text">Repetitive behaviors undertaken consistently tend to be labeled as compulsive. These behaviors may or may not be obviously detrimental to the affected animal's health. Licking certain areas of the body, as with the lower limbs in acral dermatitis, is a perfect example of this disease.These behaviors, also referred to as "obsessive compulsive disorder" (or "OCD") may or may not be associated with stress or anxiety. Though it's been postulated that stress alleviation is the function of this disease, most veterinary behaviorists seem to agree that this disease is sometimes best defined by the fact that the repetition of the behavior itself serves no apparent function.It's believed that this behavioral disorder has a genetic origin due to its increased prevalence in certain breeds. Both dogs and cats suffer from compulsive behaviors.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">•		Hemivertebrae</h5>
        
        <p class="card-text">Hemivertebrae happen when the vertebrae of the canine spine are congenitally deformed so as to fuse or otherwise develop abnormally in a manner that creates a twisting wedge in what should be a very straight spine. A deformity like this in the bony spine can mean a twisting in the spinal cord as well and, potentially, a compression of this exceedingly delicate central nervous system structure.Hemivertebrae are responsible for the characteristic "screw tail" of bulldogs, pugs and other dog breeds for which the curled tail is considered a requisite trait. In the spinal cord-less tail, however, several defective vertebrae in a row do not present a problem. In some dogs, however, one or more vertebrae other than in the tail may be affected. Luckily, most dogs are never adversely affected by this defect. In fact, this disease is typically diagnosed as an incidental finding and clinical signs of disease seldom become evident.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">•	Hyperparathyroidism </h5>
        
        <p class="card-text">Hyperparathyroidism is an uncommon disease of abnormal calcium and phosphorus regulation in dogs. It occurs when one or all of the body's four parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone. Ultimately, this leads to very high blood calcium levels. Hyperparathyroidism can be termed primary or secondary. For the purposes of this genetic disease discussion, only the primary (hereditary) forms will be discussed.Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs 1) as a result of either a benign, parathyroid hormone-secreting tumor (adenoma) on one of the four, thyroid gland-associated parathyroids or 2) due to a congenital disease of the parathyroid glands that allows for excessive production of parathyroid hormone.</p>
