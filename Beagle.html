  <div class="col-lg-6">&nbsp;<font size="4">Beagles are small to medium-sized dogs with short, smooth coats that come in a variety of colors, including white, black, brown, and tan. They are known for their friendly and playful personalities, and they make great family pets. Beagle dogs are also very intelligent dogs, and they are easy to train.Beagles are originally from England, and they were bred to track small game, such as rabbits and foxes. This can lead them astray if they catch a scent during outdoor walks, so owners should ensure their dogs are on a leash to prevent them from wandering too far. They are still used for hunting today, but they are also popular as companion dogs. This breed are relatively low-maintenance dogs, and they require regular exercise and grooming.
    Training is essential for Beagles, and their intelligence makes them quick learners. However, they can also be independent thinkers and may have a stubborn streak, especially if they catch an intriguing scent during training sessions. Positive reinforcement, especially in the form of tasty treats, works wonders. This breed’s friendly and affectionate nature extends to other animals. Beagles make good companions for other dogs and cats, especially if they are raised together from an early age. Early socialization and positive experiences with other animals can further enhance their amiable disposition.</font></div>

              <p class="card-text">Musladin-Lueke syndrome is a hereditary disorder that affects beagles that manifests in extensive fibrosis of the skin and joints. It is named after beagle breeders Anton Musladin and Ada Leuke. It is caused by a number of recessive mutations affecting fibrillin-1, a major component of microfibrils.It affects several organ systems, including the skeleton, heart, skin, and muscle. According to the American Kennel Club's Canine Health Foundation, "beagles with Musladin-Leuke syndrome are born with several defects characterized by short outer toes on the front and sometimes all four feet, high set creased ears on a flat skull with extra cartilage in them, slant narrowed eyes, and very thick tight skin with little scruff." Affected dogs are usually smaller than average, and have a very stiff gait. Seizures have also been noted in affected dogs.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Reverse sneezing, also known as inspiratory paroxysmal respiration, is a clinical event that occurs in dogs and cats. It is possibly caused by a muscle spasm at the back of the animal's mouth, more specifically where the muscle and throat meet.Other hypotheses state that it occurs when the animal's soft palate gets irritated. The irritation causes spasms in the soft palate muscle thus narrowing the trachea. Because the trachea is narrowed, the pet isn't able to inhale a full breath of air, resulting in forceful attempts to inhale through their nose. This causes the pet to experience reverse sneezing.</p>

It is a genetic (polygenic) trait that is affected by environmental factors. It is common in many dog breeds, particularly the larger breeds, and is the most common single cause of arthritis of the hips.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Cherry eye is a disorder of the nictitating membrane (NM), also called the third eyelid, present in the eyes of dogs and cats. Cherry eye is most often seen in young dogs under the age of two.Common misnomers include adenitis, hyperplasia, adenoma of the gland of the third eyelid; however, cherry eye is not caused by hyperplasia, neoplasia, or primary inflammation.In many species, the third eyelid plays an essential role in vision by supplying oxygen and nutrients to the eye via tear production. Normally, the gland can turn inside-out without detachment.Cherry eye results from a defect in the retinaculum which is responsible for anchoring the gland to the periorbita</p>

              <p class="card-text">Corneal endothelial dystrophy is an age-related change that affects the inner layer of the corneal, the endothelium. Leakage of fluid into the cornea causes edema, causing a bluish appearance. This will eventually involve the whole cornea. Bullous keratopathy (blisters in the cornea) may also form, leading to nonhealing and recurrent corneal ulceration. Hyperosmotic agents are sometimes used topically for treatment, but success with these medications is inconsistent and can cause irritation. Bad cases may require a corneal transplant or thermokeratoplasty, which is a grid of superficial burns to the cornea that causes anterior stromal fibers to contract and prevent fluid uptake by the stroma.The most commonly affected breeds are the Boston Terrier, Chihuahua, and Dachshund. The age of onset in the Boston is five to nine years and eight to thirteen years in the Chihuahua and Dachshund. The disease is similar to Fuchs' dystrophy in humans.</p>
