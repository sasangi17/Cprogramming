  <div class="col-lg-6">&nbsp;<font size="4">The Havanese is a toy breed and the national dog of Cuba. Their playful, affectionate personalities accompany good-natured temperaments and intelligence, making them lovely family dogs. Plus, they're quite cute, with round faces and floppy ears.The breed is a popular choice for learning tricks, competing in dog sports, and entering dog shows. The clever Havanese is also known to make up their own games, training their owners to play them. They may also serve as therapy dogs, especially those who are socialized and enjoy meeting strangers.If you want a small dog with a relatively easygoing temperament, the Havanese might be right for you. These dogs tend to be great with children and other pets. The friendly and gentle personality of the Havanese makes them suitable for many types of homes, including apartments. They're also a great choice for travel and RV living because they're small and don't bark much.</font></div>

        <h5 class="card-title">• Skin problems 	</h5>
        
        <p class="card-text">The popularity of Havanese dogs has led to a large number of puppies being bred by inexperienced breeders. This may have contributed to the prevalence of inflammatory skin problems such as sebaceous adenitis, which occurs when the glands stop producing moisturising sebum.This condition is characterised by dry skin that’s scaly, with patches of hair loss. Not very comfortable for poor Fluffy! If you notice your dog’s coat is thinning or he seems uncomfortable when you scratch his back with your fingernails, it could be a sign of this immune-mediated disorder. Other symptoms include a musty aroma, matted hair and silver or white scales on the skin.</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">•	Anxiety</h5>
       
        <p class="card-text">Havanese make loyal companions, but there’s a downside to their attentiveness. They can experience anxiety when their humans leave the house, there are loud noises or they don’t get enough exercise.Signs of anxiety include pacing, whining, shaking, destructiveness, howling and losing control of their bodily fluids.When leaving home for a short duration, set up a cosy crate with familiar toys to create a feeling of safety. On top of this, aim for at least one hour of gentle daily exercise, which encourages calmness.</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">•	Ichthyosis</h5>
        
        <p class="card-text">Heart failure is one of the biggest killers of older Havanese dogs, and this usually occurs when the valve weakens over time  to the point that it can no longer shut properly. This causes a leak to the blood flow, which puts too much pressure on the heart.Heart failure is the extreme end of the scale, but even young dogs can develop cardiovascular conditions that require medical attention.</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">•	Hip dysplasia</h5>
        
        <p class="card-text">Another havanese dogs health problem is that they are prone to dysplasia. This hereditary condition occurs when the hip joint develops abnormally, creating a misaligned hip ball and socket. Hip dysplasia often causes pain and discomfort in the rear limbs (one or both), and can even lead to chronic arthritis and immobility over time.If you notice your dog limping, favouring one leg while running or struggling to get up, please take her to the vet as soon as you can. X-rays are commonly used to diagnose the condition and anti-inflammatory drugs may be prescribed to lower pain. Targeted supplements and physical therapy can also help, and you may need to introduce a diet and exercise plan to keep weight at a manageable level.</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">• Hypoglycaemia</h5>
       
        <p class="card-text">Under havanese dogs health problems it is common for them to experience low blood sugar, due to their small digestive systems. Hypoglycaemia symptoms include weakness, pale gums, lack of coordination, trembling, convulsions, blindness, irregular heart rate and changes to appetite.In these situations, pet owners are often required to act quickly by giving their pup a dose of something sweet, like honey, which helps to raise blood sugar levels (the sweet food can be rubbed on the gums after seizures have stopped).</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">•	Cataracts</h5>
        
        <p class="card-text">Cataracts occur when a thin film covers your dog’s eye, blocking their vision. Havanese dogs have a high risk of developing cataracts, but there’s not much you can do to prevent this largely genetic condition from occurring. Unfortunately, cataracts can’t be reversed naturally but can be removed and replaced by an artificial lens, while your dog is under general anesthesia.
