  <div class="col-lg-6">&nbsp;<font size="4">The white-headed pigeon draws its name from its distinctive white head, neck, breast, and belly. In males, the wings are slate grey, along with the tail. The upperparts are grey black, with a green or purple iridescence. The bill is pink to dark red, but with a yellow or white tip. The legs and feet are pink to red. Females appear similar to males, but their white coloration is less brilliant and more muddied. Juveniles are similar to females, but with a greyer head and darker gray underparts. Juveniles have greyer feet, legs, and bills, with the bill white tipped. Adults range from 38–42 cm (15–17 in) from beak to tail, and weigh around 420 g (15 oz).The eye ring and legs are red and the eyes are pale orange or yellow.Their call is loud and gruff sounding like "WHOO!" followed by a gruff inhalation sounding "uk" (repeated three times). Sometimes the call is a low "oom".</font></div>

          <h5 class="card-title">•	Canker </h5>
        
          <p class="card-text">Canker is caused by a tiny organism called a protozoan and typically causes breathing problems. It is a disease that is easily transmitted from bird to bird but thankfully it is not able to survive outside of a bird for more than a few minutes. Pigeons pass canker on to other pigeons when they share water bowls, exhibit billing with other adult pigeons, and feed young pigeons crop milk ( a semi-solid, crumbly excretion high in fat and protein)The organism that causes canker is typically found in a pigeon's crop, throat, bile duct, cloaca, proventriculus, or other parts of the digestive tract. Nodules from canker may also be found on the navel in a nestling pigeon or in pigeon sinuses. Symptoms of canker will vary depending on what part of the body it is found in but since it most commonly affects the throat, most pigeons will have breathing difficulties due to the nodules on the tonsils. Other signs of canker, besides the visible nodules and breathing issues, include diarrhea, weight loss, lethargy, and bleeding from the mouth and cloaca. Symptoms worsen if the disease is not treated and canker can cause death.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">•Pigeon Worms</h5>
         
          <p class="card-text">Like many other types of animals, pigeons can harbor various kinds of worms in their intestinal tract. Roundworms, tapeworms, and hairworms grow and live in the digestive tract of pigeons and can cause diarrhea, weakness, increased susceptibility to other diseases, and performance issues in competitive pigeons. Sometimes you can see worms passed in the feces of a pigeon but oftentimes their eggs are found during a microscopic examination of the droppings.Pigeons get worms from eating insects and ingesting infected droppings from other birds so it can be very difficult to prevent your pigeon from getting worms. Regular microscopic exams of your pigeon's droppings are recommended to screen for these parasites and treatment involves medication that, like other pigeon medicine, can be added to the water or given orally in a syringe.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">•	Coccidia</h5>
          
          <p class="card-text">coccidia is an intestinal protozoan that is found in pigeons and other animals and causes diarrhea, loss of nutrient absorption, weakness, lethargy and weight loss. Coccidia is easily transmitted from pigeon to pigeon when they ingest infected droppings and is often found in small, acceptable quantities in most pigeon lofts. If a pigeon is acting normally and a small amount of coccidia is found, it is often not treated.Coccidia is a microscopic organism so you will not be able to see it without a microscope, therefore regular fecal examinations by your vet are recommended to make sure your pigeon does not have an abundance of coccidia. Despite small amounts of the protozoan being acceptable, if your pigeon has coccidia and loose droppings (the most common indication of coccidia) or other symptoms, they should receive medications to treat it.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">•	Hexamita</h5>
          
          <p class="card-text">Very similar to the protozoan that causes canker in pigeons, this organism is also found in the digestive tract of pigeons. Thankfully, hexamita is not as serious for most pigeons as canker is but it is still recommended to treat a bird that is diagnosed with it. The organism can be found microscopically in feces and is often confused with canker due to its similar appearance. It can cause vomiting, weight loss, and bloody diarrhea if it overpopulates your pigeon's intestinal tract but typically goes unnoticed in normal pigeons</p>

          <p class="card-text">External parasites, such as lice, mites, and flies are a real bother to your pet pigeon.These annoying pests not only bite and irritate your pigeon but can also cause more serious damage, such as blood loss or introduce disease to your bird. A scaly appearance to the unfeathered areas of your pigeon, tiny holes in the feather shafts, and itchy birds are all signs of external parasites. Depending on the type of parasite, medicated sprays are typically used on a pigeon that is infected.</p>

          <p class="card-text">There are many different strains of chlamydia in pigeons and some birds do not show symptoms. but if your pigeon is stressed they may have a flare-up of this virus.Medications to treat the virus can be given to birds showing symptoms of chlamydia but the disease cannot be cured. Respiratory infections caused by the virus are the real concern in pigeons who have chlamydia so they are usually treated symptomatically while ensuring their environment is ideal (avoid dampness, fluctuating temperatures, etc)</p>
